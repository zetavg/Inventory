# Inventory

An RFID asset management solution for home and business.

With an inventory combined with the help of RFID technology, it'll be a breeze to track item availability, prevent loss, and locate them when needed. [See a demo video here on YouTube](https://bit.ly/inventory-demo-yt).

Here are some guides for you to get started: [Get Started Guides](https://docs.inventory.ztg.app/get-started/setup).


## Documents

See documents on [https://docs.inventory.ztg.app](https://docs.inventory.ztg.app).


## Development

The majority of the codebase is written in TypeScript, employing React Native to build the mobile app. Java and Objective-C native modules are used for handling UART/Bluetooth communications with RFID devices, and other heavy-lifting tasks such as supporting index build for full-text searching.

For more details on each project component, check the following directories:

* `App/` - the React Native iOS/Android app.
* `Data/` - data schema and data logic.
* `packages/` - other shared modules.
